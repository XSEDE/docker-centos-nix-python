# docker-centos-nix-python
Docker container with Nix and Python to be used in XSEDE compute environment (currently in development)

The top-level prod-env.nix is a commented-out example resulting in an environment with
numpy and Pillow available to the default Python3 interpreter.  See mandle-example 
for a toy app with attendant slurm script.
